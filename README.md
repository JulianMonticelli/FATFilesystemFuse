This is an operable FAT filesystem to work with FUSE (Filesystem in USEr space). It was written as my final project for CS1550 during my Spring 2017 semester at Pitt.

NOTICE: If I recall correctly, there was a bug that I could not successfully find before turning the project in - I was, however well aware of it. It was an issue with larger, multi-block files. It didn't happen with just a few blocks, so the issue was hard to track down and I failed to do so in the time frame before submission. It definitely has to do with block allocation and linking. I turned it in and forgot to ever find it because the project was behind me. Now that it is part of an online portfolio, I feel the work is incomplete and I will come back to this at some point and fix the bug.
